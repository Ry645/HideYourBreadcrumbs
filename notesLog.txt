for moving up trees from leaf to root, you can set up signals in the leaves and connect them in the root's scene tree editor

DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ABSTRACTION
it's generally not worth it since you'll forget how to set up the abstraction anyways
just stick with hard-coded values, and abstract it when the time comes

allows for more flexible control flow
