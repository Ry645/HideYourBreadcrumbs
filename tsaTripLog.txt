1: Added get unique name capability
next add pickup node parent to each item so i can store the resource as a file instead of a path

2: got rid of get_parent.get_parent atrocity and used references injected by the parent at ready function insteaed
make sure to have root to leaf control flow so i don't have to get_parent.get_parent.get_parent.get_parent.get_parent.get_parent
and instead just say %tooltip.setVars()

3: added in text file logs to track progress easier and write down important notes
At the end of the day, I'm still learning, and I always will be.
